# Foodie Finder

Inside the main branch of the Front end, you'll find all the CSS and pages for the front end. Inside our backend Repo in the main branch as well you'll find all of our back-end features and our API stuff and everything with our backend.

Something we struggled with was we were having a lot of issues with our login and sign-in buttons early on. We tried to do a modal using bootstrap but eventually, it broke and we couldn't do anything about it, we kept trying to get back and change things or change things back but nothing would work. We eventually scrapped the bootstrap modal for the login/sign-in for one made from scratch which ended up working almost perfectly. When we made modals for our login and signup buttons we couldn't figure out how to get the closing button to work. This frustrated us because when we made our original modal pop up when you first enter the page we had no problems with this at all. We ended up scrapping the close-out button and just telling our user to use ESC since we couldn't figure out any other way to get the button to work. Another big issue we started having towards the end was our API not working, we went back and forth with trying to scrap the API and just hard coding a Chicago-based app instead of a zip code-based one but eventually after hours of hard work we got it to work properly. Connecting our front end to the back end was a bit tricky as well it took us a bit longer than we expected as well but after a hard night of putting our heads together we ended up getting our front end and back end to chatter a bit.

The Foodie Finder app is fully working and functional. When you first enter the page you get confronted with a modal explaining our app and our vision for this app. After reading it and closing out of it you get the option of jumping straight into randomizing a restaurant for your zip code. If you want you can also create an account or log back in so you can save some restaurants you like. After you click the random button you get a restaurant near the zip code you entered. It brings up information on the restaurant like when it's open, a link to the restaurant to buy food, and other information you need to see to believe.
