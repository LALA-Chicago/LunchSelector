Inside the main branch of the Front end you'll find all the css and pages for the front end. Inside of our backend Repo in the main branch as well you'll find all of our back end features and our API stuff and everything with our backend.

Some things we struggled with was we were having a lot of issues with our login and signin buttons early on. We tried to do a modal using bootstrap but eventually it broke and we couldn't do anything about it, we kept trying to get back and change things or change things back but nothing would work. We eventually scrapped the bootstrap modal for the login/signin for one made from scratch which ended up working almost perfectly. When we made modals for our login and signup buttons we coudln't figure out how to get the closing button to work. This really frustrated us because when we made our original modal to pop up when you first enter the page we had no problems with this at all. We ended up scrapping the close out button and just telling our user to use ESC since we couldn't figure out any other way to get the button to work. Another big issue we started having towards the end was our API not working, we went back and forth with trying to scrap the API and just hard coding a chicago based app instead of a zip code based one but eventually after hours of hard work we got it to work properly. Connecting our front end to back end was a bit tricky as well it took us a bit longer than we expected as well but after a hard night of putting our heads together we ended up getting our front end and back end to chatter a bit.

The Foodie Finder app is fully working and functional. When you first enter the page you get confronted with a modal explaining our app and our vision for this app. After reading it and closing out of it you get the option of jumping straight into randomizing a resturant for your zip code. If you want you can also create an account or log back in so you can save some resturants you like. After you click the random button you get a resturant near the zip code you entered. It brings up information on the resturant like when it's open, a link to the resturant to buy food and other information you need to see to believe.
